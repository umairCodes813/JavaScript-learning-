    <h2> In Second JS file name let,var,const I study About <code> let,var and const </code> and about we try not to use <code>  var </code> even <code> 1% </code> , to use <code> let </code> more and more of we use mostly <code> const </code> so if we enen don't understand anything we use <code> const </code> and if we want to change we can change it later into <code> let </code> </h2>

        <h3> <dt> var </dt> </h3>
        <dd> “We should not use the <code> var </code> type because it declares variables globally. If we declare a <code> var </code> inside a block and print it, and then declare another <code> var </code> outside the block and print it, both times the value from the block will be printed.” </dd>
     </dl>
     <dl>
        <h3> <dt> let </dt> </h3>
        <dd> “We should use <code> let </code> most of the time because it declares variables locally. The values in both places are different, so they will be printed separately. Also, in <code> let </code>, we cannot re-initialize the same variable again to change its value.” </dd>
     </dl>

        <h3> <dt> const </dt> </h3>
        <dd> “When we use <code> const </code>, it means that this value cannot be changed throughout the entire program. We mostly use <code> const </code> for variables whose values we do not want to change in the whole program. We should use <code> const </code> more often because its advantage is that we can later change it to <code> let </code> if needed.” </dd>
